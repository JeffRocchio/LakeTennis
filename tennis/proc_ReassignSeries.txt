Move a Series to a different club:

	1.	Edit the series and change it's 'Club' field to the new club.
	
	2.	Ensure that all the people in the series have Person records in the
		new club.
		
	3.	For each 'eligible' record in the series, edit the person field so it
		points to the correct person record in the new club. (This has to be done
		by hand for each eligible record, one-by-one.)
		
	4.	For each 'RSVP' record in the series, edit the person field so it points
		to the correct person record in the new club. (See below query to help
		with this.)
		
		
For Step #4 Above - Query to Execute for each person-row in the grid:
>>>-----------

---This Query shows all the RSVP records that need to be changed:
SELECT 
series.ID AS seriesID, 
series.ShtName AS seriesShtName, 
Event.ID AS evtID, 
Event.Name AS evtName, 
rsvp.ID AS rsvpID, 
person.ID AS prsnID, 
person.PName AS prsnPName 
FROM 
tennis.rsvp rsvp, 
tennis.Event Event, 
tennis.series series, 
tennis.person person 
WHERE ( 
Event.ID=rsvp.Event AND 
series.ID=Event.Series AND 
person.ID=rsvp.Person) 
AND ((series.ID=4))
ORDER BY person.ID;

---This Query shows all the RSVP records for a single person that need to be
	changed:
SELECT 
Event.ID AS evtID, 
Event.Name AS evtName, 
rsvp.ID AS rsvpID, 
person.ID AS prsnID, 
person.PName AS prsnPName 
FROM 
tennis.rsvp rsvp, 
tennis.Event Event, 
tennis.person person 
WHERE ( 
Event.ID=rsvp.Event AND 
person.ID=rsvp.Person) 
AND ((Event.Series=4 AND rsvp.Person=1))
ORDER BY rsvp.Person;


---This Query then actually implements the RSVP record changes for a single
	person. Be sure to put the Series ID# in the 2nd item of the WHERE clause.
	Then for each person in the series ---> 
	   Put *new* person ID# in the SET statement, 
	   And the old ID# in the last item of the WHERE clause:
UPDATE 
rsvp, 
Event 
SET rsvp.Person=13 
WHERE rsvp.Event=Event.ID AND Event.Series=4 
AND rsvp.Person=10
;
