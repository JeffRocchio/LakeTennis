<P>
<strong>The following are our guidelines for the fall 2006 "Contra League."</strong><BR><BR>


<OL CLASS=NumL1>
	<LI CLASS=Normal>We shall begin and end the competition on the same weeks the USTA Fall Combo league begins and ends.</LI>
	
	<LI CLASS=Normal>We have devised the competition such that those playing in the USTA Fall Combo league are included. And included in a manner that gives them credit for their league play.</LI>
	
	<LI CLASS=Normal>We will use a point system to determine a rank-order for each club member. We will also play around with a "quality rating" system that accounts for your record against stronger and weaker players to arrive at a "Quality Rating." We are interested in seeing if this Q-Rating system helps us determine real-world strength in match-play.</LI>
	

	<LI CLASS=Normal><strong>Points Sytem</strong> - we use the following rules for scoring points:</LI>

	<OL CLASS=NumL2>
		<LI CLASS=Normal>1 point for each game won.</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>2 additional points for each set won. This will reward those who consistently win sets, yet should not be too impossible to catch up with.</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>Tie-breakers are used only to determine set winners, they will not count as a game for points purposes.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>Same point scoring used for those playing in that Saturday's USTA match. E.g., if you play River Run and lose 6-3, 6-4 you we'll record you as having earned 7 points for that Saturday's play. If you win a 3rd-set tiebreaker we'll count that as 2-points for winning a set. So if you win at River Run 6-3, 2-6, 1-0 we'll give you 6+2+2=10 points.</LI>
	
	</OL>

	<LI CLASS=Normal><strong>Quality Rating System</strong> - Tennis Engine:</LI>
	
	<OL CLASS=NumL2>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>Tennis Engine is a seperate web-site. It's purpose is to run tennis ladders for clubs.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>They have a "quality" points-scoring system which ranks each club member based on game and match win-loss records. But this "quality" point system also takes into consideration the strenght of your opponents. So, for example, if you win a few games against a stronger player you score more points than if you win the same number of games against a weaker opponent.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>They do have a ladder-type for Doubles.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>The system will work even if we play 1-set "matches" vs full 3-set matches. I have confirmed this with the site's owner.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>By using Tennis Engine we can all see our points and rankings anytime we wish. The system will recalculate everything dynamically as scores are entered. They have a nice page that would show our club's rankings.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>The USTA match play will NOT be included in the Tennis Engine results. Instead we have decided to enter the scores for as many of our within club matches as we can keep track of. This way we'll get increasingly accurate tennis engine Quality Ratings over time.</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal><strong>See Here:</strong> <A HREF='http://www.tennisengine.com/league/index.asp?LgID=3412'>Tennis Engine</A></LI>

	</OL>


	<LI CLASS=Normal>Doubles only - matching up with the fall USTA league, we don't count any singles matches (we can do that come spring if this works well).</LI>
	
	<LI CLASS=Normal>Saturday's only - again, matching up with the fall USTA league, we use Thursday evening play for recreational and practice only, not as part this Contra League. This way those of us working on certain issues of technique can still do that, blowing our games on Thursday in the interest of improving and coming Saturday morning with our game-face on.</LI>
	
	<LI CLASS=Normal>We count in the point-scoring only 2 sets per person per Saturday. This is necessary to fairly include those playing in that Saturday's USTA matches. Plus this rule will provide a mix of competitive play and pure 'it don't count' recreational play each Saturday. You can count any two sets as long you, your partner and your opponents <strong>agree beforehand</strong> that the set is to be scored. You cannot wait until the morning is over and then determine which two sets you want to score.</LI>
	
	<LI CLASS=Normal>We begin and end the competition on the same weeks the USTA Fall Combo league begins and ends.</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>Point scoring is independent of doubles partner. The intent is to
be able to make this work even tho we're playing with different partners. In fact....</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>You MUST switch partners after your first set ('cept, of course, for those playing in the USTA match that day). The idea here is to see if we can generate some statistical data that tells us who plays well together. We can use this in the Spring league to help us set teams. If this works we can fix doubles teams for our winter practice sessions so that come spring we'll have honed doubles teams that can read each other's minds on-court. Well, that's the theory.</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>You must be willing to faithfully record your scores, your playing partners and your opponents for those 2 sets each Saturday morning and turn those scores in to whomever we can brow-beat into doing the data-entry for us.</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>The WINNER of each set has to donate $1 to our end-of-season party. The 2nd-place finisher of the series, by points, has to contribute $10. The final series winner has to contribute $20. I'm thinking reverse psychology - it'd be just my luck to win since
I'm such a stingy bas***.</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>We title this endevor the Holbrook USTA Contra League. Well, we'd probably get sued if we used 'USTA' in a title like that - so maybe we'll go with the "Holbrook Fall 06 Contra League."</LI>
