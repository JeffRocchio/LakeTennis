&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Individual lesson, Half-Hr: $20.<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Individual lesson, Full-Hr: $35.<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Clinic, 2-4 people: $40 per hr (Total, not for each person).<BR />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Clinic, 5-8 people: $60 per hr.<BR />
-----------<BR />
For multi-person clinics the cost generally works out to be about $10 a person.
Additionally, I like to cap the number of people at eight because after that it turns into too much standing around. i like to keep everyone involved and moving! Location wise, I'm open to anything, public courts or neighborhood courts, or wherever would work best for the group. <BR /><BR />

I've been teaching tennis on and off for the better part of ten years with interludes during college and while I was teaching high school history. I played tennis for UNCC from 1999-2002 and spent the following year working with the team as an assistant coach. I have also worked at various clubs around the Charlotte area, including North Charlotte Racquet Club and Skybrook. <BR />
