<strong>Message From Team Captain Ken (January 23):</strong>
</P>

<P>I have now officially registered us as Team #<strong>7039355791</strong>, <strong>LKSU-Holbrook Park</strong> for the USTA 2007 Lake Norman 3.5 Spring League. You can sign up and check us and our competition out by going to <A HREF='http://national.usta.com/leagues/formslogin.asp'>http://national.usta.com/leagues/formslogin.asp</A></P>

<P>Please begin signing up as soon as possible because we must have 8 players at a min. in a short period of time !</P>  

<P>League play will begin March 1 and run no later than June 13th.</P>

<P>It is imperative that you check your schedule for conflicts that will prevent you from playing in a Saturday morning/ afternoon match during this time and let me know NOW!</P>

<P><FONT COLOR='RED'><strong>ONCE OUR TEAM SCHEDULE IS POSTED, IT WILL BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SHOW UP ON TIME FOR THE MATCH OR FIND YOUR OWN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MATCH. PLEASE BE SURE I HAVE YOUR BEST FUNCTIONING PHONE NUMBER AS I WILL POST PHONE NUMBERS WITH THE SCHEDULE.</strong></FONT></P>

<P>We have a responsibility to each other and our competition to never forfeit a position. It is unacceptable and disrespectful to waste everybody's time with a 'no show, no call'.</P>

<P>As always, this is your team and you will be expected to share captain responsibilities. I need your input on competitive doubles pairings. In addition, I will ask you to captain certain matches in my absence.</P>

<P>Please contact me with your suggestions and questions. Remember I need your conflict dates now.</P>

<P>Thanks, Ken</P>

<STRONG>ADDITIONAL DETAILS:</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Cost. There are fees associated with playing in the USTA Spring League. It usually adds up to around $30 for the season. These consist of USTA fees and court fees. As a club we don't change any additional fees. We won't know the final figure until probably another 15-30 days or so. You'll have to have all your $$ to us prior to being officially 'signed up' to play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. USTA Membership. You have to be a member in good standing of USTA to play, with a USTA membership number. You can sign up for membership at the USTA web site. There's a link on our web site home page for this; see "Become USTA Member" near the bottom of the home page.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. NTRP Rating. We field a Men's Adult "3.5" team. This means you must be USTA-NTRP-Rated at 3.5 *or less* to play this Spring. If you are not yet rated there is a process for "self-rating," which occurs as part of your process for registering for the team on the USTA "Tennis Link" web site (so if you are not yet rated, don't worry about this part yet - just make sure you are current with your USTA membership per #b above). There are two links on our web site home page for all this NTRP rating suff.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Format. Spring league match-events consist of 2 singles matches and 3 doubles matches per event. So they take up 5 courts and require 8 players per event. Matches are 2 full sets, with a 10-point tie-breaker used as the 3rd-set, if necessary. The event winner is the team which wins at least 3 of the five courts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Number of Players. We normally like to have 12 players signed up for spring to help ensure we don't have to forfit any matches due to availability issues. 14 players is the maximum allowed. If enough of you express interest we'll consider fielding 2 teams, BUT there is a big constraint here that may make this impractical for us: "3.01H(5)a  A player may play on *one team* in a NTRP level within this division in the same local league during the same season.  In local leagues where NTRP levels are divided into flights, players may *not* play in more than one flight."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Day of Play. *Saturday's*. The Saturday match-events have start-times that range from 8am to 1pm. Historically we have mostly been scheduled to start our matches in the 8-10am range.</P>
