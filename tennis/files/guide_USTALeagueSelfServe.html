<P>
<strong>The following are our guidelines for running the USTA league matches in a mostly self-service mode:</strong><BR><BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;We request that you self-service your availability status now, and during the season. Use the web site to do this. For any match in which you have not yet been scheduled to play, please keep your availability status up-to-date. This will help in two ways: a) It will help in pre-scheduling who is to play in each match. b)  It will help anyone needing a sub see who is  available to help them out. See 'tools' below.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Each week's match will have a designated match Captain. The designated Captain will be marked in the roster-grid on the web site with a red 'c' in their RSVP cell for that match.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;We will pre-determine who is playing for each week of the season. This will help you plan your weekends as you will know which Saturday's you are scheduled to play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Given the pre-determined list of who is scheduled to play in a given match, the designated Captain has the final say over the actual lineup for that week. They can make the lineup at the last minute on-site at the match, or any point ahead of time if they wish.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;If, after being scheduled to play in a given match, you become unavailable - it is your responsibility to find a sub for yourself. You are not permitted to put this burden on the shoulders of either Arnold, Jeff or the designated Captain for your match.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Whoever is the designated Captain for a match must strike an agreement with the opposing captain on who will enter the scores after the match. (Some captains go by the rule "winning captain enters scores," some go by the rule "home team captain enters scores.")</P>

<P>----------------------<BR>
<STRONG>TOOLS:</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;I have attempted to put all the tools and info you need on our club's web site. The Roster grid is your master 'dashboard' to access everything.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;LOGIN to the site at the bottom of the roster grid page. This will provide access to what you need. Use your last name - all small letters, not caps - for both your user ID and your password.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;Once logged in you will see "Edit" links in the RSVP cells next to your name. Click on those to update your match availability status. You can also put in any general notes or comments about your status as you do this (e.g., if you're "tentative" why this is so and when you'll know for certain).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;On the roster grid page, click on the title at the top of the page to see the information, or links to information, that you'll need. E.g., the link to our team's USTA page on TennisLink, instructions for posting the scores, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;On the roster grid page click on the date for any given match to see pretty much whatever you need for that specific match. Driving directions to the location, opposing captain name and number, who is scheduled to play, the match ID# for tennislink, etc.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;If you need to send an email to the team (e.g., to seek a sub for yourself) you can use the Make Email Address List link at the bottom of the roster grid page. This link will generate a list of email addresses for only those playing in the league (not the whole club). You can cut/paste that email address list into your email program's TO line.</P>
