<p CLASS=pgHdrTopic2>Guidelines for Singles Ladder</P>

<P>This page provides rules and guidelines for our club's Singles
Tennis Ladder.</P>

<P>The purpose of the ladder is to encourage competitive singles
matches within our group of players as a means of preparing for 
the spring USTA league season. In addition to the two singles positions
in the spring league that we wish to be competitive at, singles
experience can also help improve our doubles play. Therefore, all
are encourage to participate in this ladder.</P>



<P STYLE='font-weight:bold; margin-bottom:0'>TENNIS LADDER RULES</P>
<P STYLE='font-size:small; margin-top:0'>(The following rules were derived from about a half-dozen community,
college and private club tennis ladder programs.)</P>

<OL CLASS=NumL1>
	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		The challenge ladder is published on our club's web site and will
		be udated on a best-effort basis, by the Ranking Director, upon
		receipt of scores. Current Ranking Director is:
		<A HREF='http://laketennis.com/tennis/dispPerson.php?ID=2&FORMAT=FULL'>Jeffrey Rocchio</A>.
	</LI>
		
	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		The winner of the match must report the results of the match
		to the Ranking Director or the match will not show up on the ladder.
		Scores should be reported by email as soon as possible after
		completion of the match.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Individual match scores will be recorded into a
		<A HREF='http://tennisengine.com/league/index.asp?LgID=3730'>
		Tennis Engine League</A>
		set up for this specific purpose. This will also allow us to see
		an accumulated Quality Rating for singles play.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Players may challenge up to 4 positions above them.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		<STRONG>Ladder Placement:</STRONG>
	</LI>

	<OL CLASS=NumL2>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			If the challenger is the winner, he will take the loser's
			position on the ranking list. The loser will drop down one position on
			the ranking list, thus forcing the remainder of the list down one
			position.
		</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Once a match has been completed, the loser does not have a right to
			rechallenge the winner until a time of at least 1-week has elapsed.
		</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			If a match is forfeited it will be scored and treated as a regular
			loss.
		</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Initial Ladder Positions: Jan-20-2007 - To encourage better participation
			I have eliminated the setting of initial positions. anyone can challenge
			anyone. The
			first winner will be slotted into position 1, the first loser will go
			into postion 2; and we'll take it from there. (I had initially set the
			initial ladder positions based on the Tennis Engine
			doubles quality-rating scores as of Dec-13.)
		</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			A new club member (someone joining our group after the ladder has
			begun) will be placed at the bottom of the ladder.
		</LI>
		
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			A person who cannot play (injury, travel, etc.) will be placed on a
			temporarily inactive list. To
			return to the ladder the returning player may challenge the player
			residing at his/her original position. The challenge match must be
			played within 10 days (allowance given for vacation, and company trips,
			and the person challenged must not make new challenges until the
			Entrance Match is completed). If the returning player loses the
			challenge he is then placed in the position immediately following (ie; 1
			position below) his original position.
		</LI>
		
		</OL>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		A challenge must be accepted and played within one week. If the
		person being challenged is unable to play the match within 1 week
		it shall be considered a forfeit. However, a player need accept only
		one challenge match per week. Any additional challenges should be
		scheduled as soon as convenient in the following week. Please keep
		in mind that the goal of the ladder is to provide a forum for
		competitive matches, and consequently, all players are encouraged to
		work with each other to minimize forfeits (for example, challengers
		should attempt to accomodate special situations, such as business
		travel).
	</LI>
		
	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		If in a given calendar week a player is unable to obtain an opponent
		the player may challenge the next highest ranked players in the ladder
		above the 4-limit until a challenge is accepted. It is not permissible
		to skip over a challenge to players in the sequential ladder order
		who are ready and willing to play during the week a match is desired.
		The match result shall be revoked if a player
		affected by the match outcome contests the result and the Ranking
		Director confirms that the player was not given a match opportunity.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Challenge matches, once accepted, cannot be cancelled due to
		changes in the ladder. For example: on Monday, player A (#25) challenges player
		B (#20) and schedules a match for the following Friday. On Wednesday,
		B(#2O) challenges and defeats C (#16). Now B becomes #16 and B is
		apparently out of A's range. However, since the challenge was properly
		made and accepted, B is obligated to play A and, if B is defeated, A
		moves from #25 to #16.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		The player who is challenged has the choice of courts within a
		reasonable radius of Holbrook.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		The player who makes a challenge will provide the balls for the
		match. Balls used must be mutually acceptable to the participants.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		U.S.T.A. league rules will be followed, in particular:
		
		<OL CLASS=NumL2>

			<LI CLASS=Normal>
				Best two out of three sets.
			</LI>
			
			<LI CLASS=Normal>
				10 point tie breaker for the 3rd set, if needed.
			</LI>
			
		</OL>
	
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		For judication of any disputes arising during a match, contact the
		Ranking Director after you have finished the match. Enforcement,
		judication and interpretation of all rules will be at the discretion of
		the Ranking Director.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		A player whose contact information changes (email, home phone, work
		phone or cell phone) should contact Jeffrey Rocchio 
		as soon as possible in order to keep the club phone list information
		as up-to-date as possible.
