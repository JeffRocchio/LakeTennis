<P>
	Captains-Please make sure that your
	matches start at the scheduled start time. Warm up and scorecard
	exchange should take place prior to match time. Read over
	the following procedures and let me know if you have questions. It
	is important that all matches start on time. Matches are
	staggered throughout the day on Saturdays and some
	weeknights...please be considerate of the teams that follow. 
</P>

<P>Thanks, Iris</P>

<STRONG>RULES:</STRONG></P>


<OL CLASS=NumL1>
	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Captains should simultaneously exchange
		completed scorecards 15 minutes prior to the start time , even if
		weather and/or courts are questionable. A team match is started when
		the first ball, or any of the three or five positions (lines), is put
		into play. Prior to the start of a team match, if injury to, illness,
		or disqualification of a player occurs, the affected team may
		substitute a player who is immediately ready to play and may adjust
		their lineup at the affected position only. If no substitute is made
		within the 15-minute default period, the default will be awarded at
		that position. After the start of a team match, if injury to or
		illness to a player occurs, the opponents will be awarded default for
		that match only.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Forfeits must be done by forfeiting the
		lowest positions first. A FORFEIT CAN ONLY BE GRANTED TO A
		PLAYER WHO IS PRESENT AND DRESSED TO PLAY.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		The 15 minute default rule is in
		effect. Example: Scheduled start time is 8:30 a.m. Teams
		should arrive for warm up by 8:15 a.m. Captains exchange
		scorecards and any players not present by scheduled start time are
		moved to the bottom positions, so that defaults will be from the
		bottom up. The #2 singles must be defaulted before #1 singles;
		#3 doubles must be defaulted before #2 or #1 doubles. If a team
		is missing two players, they may default #1 singles &amp; #2 singles
		or #3 doubles. Missing players are moved to the bottom positions and
		will be defaulted at 8:45 a.m. if the players have not shown. 
		All other positions should start on time and only the bottom
		position will be effected by the missing players.
