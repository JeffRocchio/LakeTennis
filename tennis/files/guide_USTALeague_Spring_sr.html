<strong>February 11, 2007:</strong>
</P>

<P>We are now officially registered as Team #<strong>7039361353</strong>, <strong>(LRFE-Fernald/Jetton)</strong> for the USTA 2007 Lake Norman 3.5 Spring Men's Adult Senior League. You need to register yourself onto this team ASAP. Go to: <A HREF='http://national.usta.com/leagues/formslogin.asp'>http://national.usta.com/leagues/formslogin.asp</A></P>

<P>Please begin signing up as soon as possible because we must have 6 players at a minimum in a short period of time!</P>  

<P><strong>Rich Fernald</strong> will be our team captain. Rich may ask others to help him out.</P>

<P>League play will begin March 1 and run no later than June 13th.</P>

<P>It is imperative that you check your schedule for conflicts that will prevent you from playing Wednesday evenings during this time and let Rich know ASAP.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR='RED'><strong>ONCE OUR TEAM SCHEDULE IS POSTED, IT WILL BE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO SHOW UP ON TIME FOR THE MATCH OR FIND YOUR OWN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MATCH. PLEASE BE SURE I HAVE YOUR BEST FUNCTIONING PHONE NUMBER AS I WILL POST PHONE NUMBERS WITH THE SCHEDULE.</strong></FONT></P>

<STRONG>ADDITIONAL DETAILS:</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Cost. There are fees associated with playing in the USTA Spring League. The USTA sign-up fee is $21. In addition We'll have to pay for court-reservations fees. We won't know the amount of the court fees until our local USTA league coordinator (Iris Ham) works out the league schedule and arranges the courts with the county.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. USTA Membership. You have to be a member in good standing of USTA to play, with a USTA membership number. You can sign up for membership at the USTA web site. There's a link on our web site home page for this; see "Become USTA Member" near the bottom of the home page.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. NTRP Rating. We field a Men's Adult "3.5" team. This means you must be USTA-NTRP-Rated at 3.5 *or less* to play this Spring. If you are not yet rated there is a process for "self-rating," which occurs as part of your process for registering for the team on the USTA "Tennis Link" web site (so if you are not yet rated, don't worry about this part yet - just make sure you are current with your USTA membership per #b above). There are two links on our web site home page for all this NTRP rating suff.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Format. Spring league seniors match-events consist of 3 doubles matches per event. So they take up 3 courts and require 6 players per event. Matches are 2 full sets, with a 10-point tie-breaker used as the 3rd-set, if necessary. The event winner is the team which wins at least 2 of the 3 courts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. Number of Players. We'd ideally like to have 10 players signed up to help ensure we don't have to forfit any matches due to availability issues.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Day of Play. *Wednesday Evenings*. The Wednesday match-events have start-times that range from 6:30am to 8:00pm.</P>
