		Login to your group.
	</LI>
		
	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Click on 'Club Phone List.'
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		At the bottom of the phone list page click on 'Add Club Member'
		under Administrative Functions.
	</LI>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
		Add the person:

	<OL CLASS=NumL2>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			In the list in the right-hand column, look to see if the person
			you want to add is in that list. (This means they already have an
			account on the site somewhere and therefore you don't need to create a new
			record for them.) IF they are on that list, click the 'ADD' link next to
			their name. This will add them to your 'club.'
		</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			If they are not on the list in the right-hand column, then at
			the bottom of the page click on the link 'ADD New Person' under
			Administrative Functions. This will give you a page to enter in their
			info. First Name, Last Name, etc. I recommend you use a standard convention
			for their ID and Password. For example, you might decide to use 
			ID=first-name and first initial of last name (e.g., Jeffrey Rocchio
			would be jeffreyr) and Password=clubID # and last name (e.g., 06rocchio).
			Two things to note here. First, this is a light-weight security system,
			so folks should not use passwords they use for their bank and such.
			Second, the ID must be unique across the whole site; so for example you
			can't create two people whose ID's are 'smith.' If you attempt to do so
			you you'll get an ugly error message when you go to save the page (I 
			am not yet catching this error to give a nice user-friendly page so all
			you get is a cryptic error from the database which is trying to tell
			you that it can't add the new person due to the duplicate ID.)
		</LI>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Once you have done either step 4.a or 4.b above the new member
			will appear in the left-hand column of the "Add and Remove People to
			Your Club" page. This means they are now members of your group.
		</LI>
	
	</OL>

	<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Now you can add the new group member (or members if you added more than
			one in step #4 above) to your team's roster-grid
			(this is a separate step because groups can have multiple teams with
			different group members playing on different teams).
	</LI>
	<OL CLASS=NumL2>
	
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Click on the 'League History' link on the group's home page.
		</LI>
		
		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Click on the name of the team you want to add the new member to.
			(E.g., "2009 Fall USTA Adult Combo League").
		</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			At the top of the roster-grid page click on the 'EDIT' link in
			() next to the team title.
		</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			On the team update page, scroll down to the 'Current Eligibility
			For This Series' section. Here you'll see two columns, simular to the
			Add Club Member page of step #4.a above. You'll see the new member you
			added in step #4 above in the right-hand column. Click the 'ADD' link
			next to their name. Once you do this they will now appear in the
			left-hand column. The left-hand column lists all the club members who
			are playing this particular team.
		</LI>

		<LI CLASS=Normal>
			Click on the 'RETURN' link at the bottom of the page. This will
			take you back to the roster-grid for this team/league. You'll see the
			new member in the grid.
		</LI>
