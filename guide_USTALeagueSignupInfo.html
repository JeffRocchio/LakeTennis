<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The spring tennis league is coming up.</strong> It will start end of Feb or early March. Arnold and I need to know the following from each of you:
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Are you interested in being *team captain* for this season? We'll provide all the tools and support you'll need. Your job would be to make the match lineups, ensure team notifications and communications, record scores, and arrange any special drill or practice sessions you deem fit.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Are you interested in *playing* in the Spring league? (See details below.) Your job here would be to make and keep your availability commitments for matches (using our web site), practice with your doubles partner, and have fun playing - even if you lose.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Who, in preferential order, are your top-3 best *doubles partners*? It's up to you to balance in your own mind fun-of-playing-with and success-of-playing-with in making your selections.
</P>

<STRONG>ADDITIONAL DETAILS:</STRONG></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;a. Cost. There are fees associated with playing in the USTA Spring League. It usually adds up to around $30 for the season. These consist of USTA fees and court fees. As a club we don't change any additional fees. We won't know the final figure until probably another 15-30 days or so. You'll have to have all your $$ to us prior to being officially 'signed up' to play.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;b. USTA Membership. You have to be a member in good standing of USTA to play, with a USTA membership number. You can sign up for membership at the USTA web site. There's a link on our web site home page for this; see "Become USTA Member" near the bottom of the home page.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;c. NTRP Rating. We field a Men's Adult "3.5" team. This means you must be USTA-NTRP-Rated at 3.5 *or less* to play this Spring. If you are not yet rated there is a process for "self-rating," which occurs as part of your process for registering for the team on the USTA "Tennis Link" web site (so if you are not yet rated, don't worry about this part yet - just make sure you are current with your USTA membership per #b above). There are two links on our web site home page for all this NTRP rating suff.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;d. Format. Spring league match-events consist of 2 singles matches and 3 doubles matches per event. So they take up 5 courts and require 8 players per event. Matches are 2 full sets, with a 10-point tie-breaker used as the 3rd-set, if necessary. The event winner is the team which wins at least 3 of the five courts.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;e. Number of Players. We normally like to have 12 players signed up for spring to help ensure we don't have to forfit any matches due to availability issues. With 8 players required per event this gives us 4 backups, and still allows ample playing opportunity for all. If enough of you express interest we'll consider fielding 2 teams, BUT there is a big constraint here that may make this impractical for us: "3.01H(5)a  A player may play on *one team* in a NTRP level within this division in the same local league during the same season.  In local leagues where NTRP levels are divided into flights, players may *not* play in more than one flight."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;f. Day of Play. *Saturday's*. The Saturday match-events have start-times that range from 8am to 1pm. Historically we have mostly been scheduled to start our matches in the 8-10am range. It does look like they are planning a men's 3.5 flight for Thursday evenings this season. That does two things - one, it will mess with our Thursday evening recreational play. Two - it may provide an option for us to play this spring's league matches on a weekday evening vs our traditional Saturday morning. We can consider that option a bit later; but for now please assume you'll be commiting to match play on Saturday mornings.</P>
