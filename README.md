# LakeTennis
Web site for tennis players

Source code for a web site I created some 10 years ago for tennis leagues and recreational play in the Charlotte, NC area. The code is rather a mess with 10 years of different coding styles and the usual kludgy maintaince and enhancements.

The environment is a LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySql (now MariaDB) and PHP.

I have two goals with this: (1) connect this repo to codenvy's Eclipse Che SaaS environment to see how well that works (2) Over some period of time rewrite the whole app for PHP 7, cleaning it up and making it more modern (I am thinking to apply the Google Material Design approach).
